## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Start)

### Every Morning (5 min)
1. Open: https://github.com/orgs/osp-group/projects/1
2. Check "In Progress" - resume your work
3. Review "Todo" - pick next task
4. Move your task to "In Progress"

### Before Starting ANY Work
```bash
# 1. Check if issue exists on board
# 2. If not, create issue first
gh issue create --repo osp-group/[repo] --title "..." --body "..."

# 3. Add to project board
gh project item-add 1 --owner osp-group --url [issue-url]

# 4. NOW you can start coding
```

### During Work
```bash
# Reference issues in commits
git commit -m "Add feature X - Fixes #1"
git commit -m "Update config - Relates to #2"

# Update issue with progress
# Check off completed tasks
# Comment on blockers
```

### When Done
1. Check all task boxes ✅
2. Add summary comment
3. Close issue → auto-moves to "Done"
4. Pick next task from board

---

## 📋 The Golden Rules

### ✅ Always Do:
1. **Check project board FIRST** before starting work
2. **Create issue FIRST** before writing code
3. **Update issue status** as you progress
4. **Reference issues** in commit messages
5. **Close issues** when complete
6. **Document blockers** immediately

### ❌ Never Do:
1. Start coding without an issue
2. Work on tasks not on the board
3. Use external tools (Notion, Trello, etc.)
4. Leave issues stale without updates
5. Close issues without summary
6. Skip linking commits to issues
