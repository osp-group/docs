## 🎓 Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
Don't try to do everything at once. Focus on Issue #1 first.

### 2. Update as You Go
Mark tasks complete in real-time. Update the issue with findings.

### 3. Link Related Work
Use GitHub references: "Fixes #1" in commit messages.

### 4. Document Everything
Each issue asks for documentation - don't skip this!

### 5. Test Thoroughly
The testing issues are as important as the implementation issues.
